#
# Agentic P0 suite for coding-agent STREAMING OUTPUT (Claude Code, Codex).
#
# Why this is agentic, not just deterministic: coding CLIs change behavior with
# every release, and deterministic assertions can pass on visibly-degraded output
# (a Codex build once streamed every assistant line TWICE yet satisfied every
# assert). So this suite also records the REAL streamed output and REQUIRES an
# agent to look at it and sign off.
#
#   capture : run the live tests, record the real output, and RESET every review
#             to pending (verdict ""). A fresh run always starts unreviewed.
#   verify  : cheap gate (no live CLI) — fails until EVERY record is agent-approved.
#   (none)  : capture then verify.
#
# Between capture and verify, the agent running the tests MUST open each
#   pkg/adapters/*/testdata/agent-reviews/*.json
# read `output` (incl. `content_chunks`) against `review_criteria`
# (no duplication, proper formatting, human-readable, correct text<->tool
# interleaving, real work done), and set:
#   agent_review.verdict              = "good"   (or "bad" with issues)
#   agent_review.reviewed_fingerprint = <the record's "fingerprint">
#   agent_review.reviewer             = "<who>"
#
# Requires: a real authenticated `claude` and `codex` CLI, `tmux`, `node`.
