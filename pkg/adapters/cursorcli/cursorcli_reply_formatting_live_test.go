// TestCursorCLIRealReplyFormattingFidelityE2E is the live contract for
// CertReplyFormattingFidelity on cursor.
//
// It asks the real CLI for a reply whose markdown structure is known up front —
// two paragraphs separated by a blank line, then a three-item list, with lines
// long enough that a terminal pane must wrap them — and asserts the answer the
// adapter hands back still has that structure.
//
// This is the only test that can prove the fix, because the defect lives in the
// gap between what the CLI wrote and what a terminal displayed. A fixture can
// show the reconciliation logic is sound (see
// TestCursorFinalAnswerPrefersUnwrappedTranscript) but cannot prove the real
// cursor-agent writes its store.db in the shape that logic assumes, nor that a
// real pane wraps the way we think. Only a live run closes that gap.

Reproduce the markdown below exactly as written, preserving every blank line and every "- " list marker, and output nothing else — no preamble, no explanation, no closing remark.

First paragraph for %s, written as one single long line of at least one hundred and forty characters so that it is certain to be wrapped by a narrow terminal window.

Second paragraph for %s, also one single long line of at least one hundred and forty characters, again long enough that the terminal will certainly wrap it onto several rows.

- second bullet for %s
- third bullet for %s`, token, token, token, token, token, token)
