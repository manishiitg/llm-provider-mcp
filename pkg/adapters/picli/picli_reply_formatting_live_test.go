// TestPiCLIRealReplyFormattingFidelityE2E is the live contract for
// CertReplyFormattingFidelity on pi.
//
// Pi is structurally exempt from the defect the other three had: it returns text
// from its injected marker stream and never parses the pane for the final answer.
// This test exists to keep that true. If anyone ever "simplifies" pi to scrape
// the pane like its siblings, or the marker hook stops being injected and the
// adapter silently falls back to pane text, the wrapping would return and this is
// what catches it.
//
// It is also the control case for the whole certification: pi passing while a
// pane-based provider fails localizes the bug to extraction rather than to the
// prompt or the model.

First paragraph for %s, written as one single long line of at least one hundred and forty characters so that it is certain to be wrapped by a narrow terminal window.

Second paragraph for %s, also one single long line of at least one hundred and forty characters, again long enough that the terminal will certainly wrap it onto several rows.
