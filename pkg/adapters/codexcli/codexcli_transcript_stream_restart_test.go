// TestCodexTranscriptStreamDoesNotReplayHistoryOnFreshProcess is the codex
// counterpart of cursorcli's restart regression test.
//
// Background: the cursor adapter had a real bug where the first turn of a FRESH
// process replayed the whole chat history as streamed content, because its only
// defence was an in-process map of already-returned message IDs against a
// CUMULATIVE transcript root. A restart emptied the map while the transcript on
// disk still held every prior turn.
//
// Codex is structurally immune for a different reason, and this test pins that
// reason down rather than trusting it: its rollout is an append-only JSONL whose
// rows carry wall-clock timestamps, and readCodexTranscriptEventsFromFile skips
// any row stamped before turnStart. That check reads from the data, not from
// process memory, so a fresh state object starting at offset 0 still cannot emit
// prior-turn rows.
//
// This is therefore a "cannot reproduce" test kept deliberately: if anyone ever
// swaps the timestamp filter for in-process dedup, it fails immediately.
