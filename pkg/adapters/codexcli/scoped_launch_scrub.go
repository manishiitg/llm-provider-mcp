// scopedLaunchScrub builds the dynamic credential scrub for a tmux launch.
//
// The unset list computed from os.Environ() cannot be complete: the pane
// inherits the long-lived tmux SERVER's environment, so a credential that
// drifted there (a backend restart, an older session) is invisible to this
// process and would survive. The scrub matches by pattern against whatever
// actually exists at exec time instead.
//
// Keep is everything legitimately in play: the caller's declared scope, and
// the credentials this adapter derived itself (its provider key, the MCP
// routes built from the caller's config). Scrubbing those would strip the
// credentials the launch just assembled.
