// PLAT-101. Claude states a reached subscription limit in several wordings,
// and the set grows over time:
//
//	You've hit your limit
//	You've hit your weekly limit · resets 11:30pm (Asia/Calcutta)
//	You've hit your 5-hour limit
//	Approaching your usage limit
//
// Matching one exact sentence missed every variant that inserts a qualifier
// between "your" and "limit" — most consequentially the weekly wording, which
// left the workflow lifecycle waiting on a terminal that would never produce
// another token. The run stayed "running" for hours with nothing executing.
//
// The pattern is deliberately shaped around what is stable in the wording (a
// possessive followed by "limit", optionally qualified) rather than around any
// single sentence, so a new qualifier does not silently reintroduce the same
// stall. It stays anchored on "hit"/"reached"/"exceeded" so ordinary prose
// mentioning the word "limit" — including an agent reasoning aloud about rate
// limits — is not misread as the pane being parked on a limit wall.

// limit, you can continue on Fable 5 with usage credits." That banner
// prints on every fresh session start, so matching claudeUsageLimitPattern
